This is a C port of an old BASIC program: the classic Super Star Trek 
game. It comes from the book _BASIC Computer Games_ edited by David Ahl of 
Creative Computing fame. It was published by Workman Publishing, 1 West 
39 Street, New York, New York, and the ISBN is: 0-89489-052-3.

This code is written in ANSI C with nothing fancy, so it should compile 
anywhere there is an ANSI C compiler.

This game is dedicated to Mike Mayfield, David Ahl, R.C.Leedom, and all who
worked on the original, Creative Computing Magazine, and the glory days of
early microcomputers with cassette storage.

Thanks!

Chris
